# Flag Keeper Game
This project is made for my Data Structure class. The main objective is simple, the player has to capture all ghosts before one of them capture the flag or the time ended. There are power-ups to spice up the game. I provided the graphic resources and coded the artificial intelligence of the ghosts. Worked with three other programmers.
